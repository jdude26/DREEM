\begin{abstract}
DREEM (\underline{D}isability-\underline{R}elated \underline{E}mpathy from \underline{E}xisting \underline{M}edia) is a novel method proposal for developing research agendas that are true to the needs of a specific population. The motivations of this work include recent critiques of technosolutionism \cite{morozovEverythingClickHere2013}, inspiring methods used in humanities and social sciences (e.g., close reading \cite{brummettTechniquesCloseReading2019} and netnography \cite{kozinetsNetnographyEssentialGuide2019}), empathy that builds partnerships \textit{with} people with disabilities rather than trying to experience disability ourselves \cite{bennettPromiseEmpathyDesign2019}, and sharing labor \cite{charltonNothingUsUs2000}â€”all as a precursor to participatory work \cite{bodkerParticipatoryDesignThat2018}. Social media is rich with tacit design knowledge and authentic perspectives from communities of people with disabilities. We propose a series of 5 empathy-building steps towards developing authentic research agendas: 1) Discover relevant media, 2) Perform close readings and autoethnographic reflections, 3) Conduct a thematic analysis, 4) Generate research problems, and 5) Verify the research agenda with authentic population stakeholders prior to participatory work. We share X case studies using DREEM, discuss the type of empathy building that is beneficial to healthy partnerships with people with disabilities, relevant background on co-designing with special populations, shared labor, and the potential of this work to help build authentic research agendas.

The first 'E' is an abstract set of hands reaching out to symbolize partnership empathy. The second 'E' is an art studio filled with tools to symbolize the content, art, and artifacts already crafted by communities of people with disabilities that enable DREEMing. The 'M' is filled with symbols related to various media forms such as films, social media interactions (e.g., favorite heart button), and broadcasts.}
